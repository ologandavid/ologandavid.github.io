									<h3 class="major">6.1151 : MicroComputer Project Laboratory (Spring 2022)</h3>
									<p><b>Objective:</b><br>
										While taking MIT’s 6.1151, each student was tasked with creating a final project that would serve as the cumulation of what we had learned about embedded microcontrollers, using either the 8051 or PSoC (Programmable System on Chip). The objective of my particular project was to build an assortment of games that would take advantage of the modularity and flexibility of the PSoC5.  The games would be played using an accompanying wireless controller run on a PSoC5LP Stick. Ideally, the two processors would run separate programs, but would operate smoothly enough not to impede gameplay. The system should be able to run three distinct games, including TIC-TAC-TOE, Pong, and a simple version of Duck Hunt. </p>
									<p><span class="vid fit"><video width="640" height="480" controls><source src="images/6.1151/Media2.mov" type="video/mp4"></video></span></p>
									<p><b>Solution:</b><br>
										My design featured two distinct parts. A wireless controller powered by a PSoC Stick and a Receiver/VGA Connector attached to the main PSoC5. The PSoC Stick encoded controller button states from the user and would transmit them wirelessly to the PSoC5 responsible for running game mechanics and updating the associated monitor.<br>

												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/6.1151/Picture4.jpg"  alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										On the main PSOC 5, a VGA2 board was wired for 2-bit color using an 74LS245N. Furthermore, a HC05 Wireless Bluetooth module and LCD Display was also wired to support Bluetooth communication with the separate controller. On the PSoC Stick, four buttons, a joystick potentiometer and HC05 module were attached to function as a controller.<br>

											</div>
										</div>
										The PSoC Stick encoded joystick positions and button states as a series of bytes representing cursor velocities and button presses. The main PSoC5 would generate a fixed frame given the current state of the game and upload that to the buffer to update the monitor. An ISR was used to receive bytes and update cursor positions and remaining targets without conflicting with screen refresh rates. The ISR triggered at a slower clock to prioritize screen refresh rates. Each game was coded in C and could be selected on startup.</p>

									<h3 class="major">2.009: Project Engineering Processes (Fall 2021)  </h3>
									<p><b>Objective:</b><br><span class="image right"><img src="images/2.009/prezi2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										As a student in 2.009, MIT’s Mechanical Engineering capstone class, teams of 20 students work together to develop and present a marketable product. Over the course of the semester, students experience the design process of a product development firm, ranging from ideation, studying market data, building models, and ultimately the construction of a quality alpha prototype. Ultimately, the semester culminates in a product demonstration and presentation broadcasted online.
										<br><br>
										<b>Solution:</b><br>
										My team (Silver) designed and manufactured Aisle Assist, a compact aisle wheelchair that eliminates the uncomfortable lifting of paraplegic flyers from their wheelchairs to their airplane seat. It takes advantage of removable, height adjustable seat panels and a backrest attached to linear rails, to gently slide and deposit users onto their aisle seat.
										<br><br>
										<div class="box alt">

												<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2.009/Picture5.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-5"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2.009/Picture6.png"  alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										Aisle Assist is rated for 99th percentile male (350 pounds) with a 2x Safety Factor ensuring it is safe for users of all shapes and sizes. The device is sized to pass airline regulations and the narrow space constraints of airline aisles.
										<br><br><span class="image left"><img src="images/2.009/Picture9.png" alt="" /></span>
										The chair works by lifting the wheelchair seat above the plane seat, sliding the user over, and retracting the backrest and seat panels once the user is comfortable. Linear rails and carriages enable the sliding action while the seat panels are raised with a winch situated behind the seat. With a 10:1 gear ratio and non-back drivable winch, the lifting mechanism is safe and requires 10 pounds of force from the flight attendant. The design was also included a deployable stabilization leg to prevent the chair from tipping during the transfer process.
										<br><br>
										My primary responsibilities included selecting linear rails given our load conditions. Since the system is essentially cantilevered, I was responsible for loading and bending calculations to prevent deflection and other beam failure modes. Additionally, as a member of the backrest assembly, I was responsible for the design and machining of key structural components on the mill, lathe, and waterjet. I presented during our teams technical review and helped with other deliverables throughout the semester. As our team’s financial officer, I was accountable for managing team finances, tracking expenses, and placing part orders.

									<!-- 2.008 Begins Here-->
									<h3 class="major">2.008 : Design and Manufacturing II (Spring 2021) </h3>
									<p><b>Objective:</b><br>
										As a student in 2.008 (Design and Manufacturing II), I worked in a team of 4 other undergraduate students to design and manufacture 50 plastic yo-yos over the course of the semester.<br>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">

											</div>
										</div>
										<!--<p><span class="image center"><img src="images/2.008/Picture13.png" alt="" /></span>-->
										<b>Solution:</b><br>
										Taking inspiration from the CITGO Sign in Boston, my team designed the yo-yos pictured below.<br>
										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2.008/citgo sign.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2.008/Picture14.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>
										The yo-yo was composed of 6 main components, the injection molded yo-yo body, red transparent pyramid, PCB, blue thermoformed letters, white cover and outer press-fit rim. The internal PCB housed a button, battery and LED and served to illuminate the transparent pyramid from behind. The transparent pyramid also served as a button, switching the LED on and off as desired.<br>

										<span class="image right"><img src="images/2.008/Picture12.png" alt="" /></span>
										While working on this team, I was tasked with the design of yo-yo body which housed all the electronics and other components. Creating the body posed multiple design challenges, particularly sizing its depth appropriately while accounting for button travel height, and injection molding defects.
										Additionally, ensuring that rim would press-fit with the body while accounting for injection molding defects like shrinkage required the use of multiple runs to assess inconsistencies in our manufacturing process.
										<br><br>
										I designed the aluminum molds for these parts in Autodesk Fusion and manufactured the tooling on the HAAS CNC. I also helped thermoform the letters and punched out the desired features using a die.
										The majority of the manufacturing took place at MIT’s LMP (Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity).

									<h3 class="major">2.00b : Toy Product Design (Spring 2019) </h3>
									<p><b>Objective:</b><br>
										As a student in 2.00b, MIT’s Toy Product Design course, students work in teams of 5 to produce a toy marketed for play and entertainment. With a focus on prototyping, aesthetic design, and safety, students present a novel product targeted towards young children at the end of the semester.
										<br><br><span class="image left"><img src="images/2.00b/Picture23.png" alt="" /></span>
										<b>Solution:</b><br>
										
										My team (Llama Team) designed and fabricated Asteroid Evader, a board game that takes inspiration from Cartoon Network’s Hole in the Wall. Players are tasked with recreating shapes shown on the removable slides out of playdoh before the timer runs out. At the end of each round, players retract the slider to see if their molded shape makes the cut.
										<br><br><span class="image right"><img src="images/2.00b/Picture21.png" alt="" /></span>
										The game consists of over 20 unique shapes, cut out of ¼” acrylic sheets, an ABS 3-D printed slider, and milled plastic game board. The timer was housed in foam sprayed with acetone to mimic the surface features of an asteroid.
										<br><br>
										Our product was tested with children in our target age group at the Children’s Museum of Action in Boston. Some of my personal responsibilities included the electronics (designed circuit and housing for the timer), and the creation of unique geometries for the removable slides.
