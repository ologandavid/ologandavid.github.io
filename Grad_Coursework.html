				<h3 class="major" id="s16.782"> 16.782 : Planning and Decision Making in Robotics (Fall 2023)</h3>
				<p><b>Objective:</b><br>
					As a student in 16.782, my team and I decided to tackle the challenge of motion planning for
					multiple robotic agents in complex environments. Especially as robotics continues to expand into
					areas like search and rescue, exploration, and warehousing, the desire for autonomous robots capable
					of performing collision free coordinated tasks has noticeably escalated. Given my current research
					in quadruped robots and the unique mobility the platform provides, I decided it would be interesting
					to employ a variety of multi-agent planning strategies to see which performed best.
					<br><br>
					<b>Solution:</b><br>
					To implement each planner, we leveraged Quad-SDK, my labâ€™s ROS-based framework for quadrupedal
					locomotion. By incorporating its suite of visualization tools, local footstep planner, and low-level
					motor controller, we were able to seamlessly integrate and test our planner performance on a variety
					of terrain. For each sampling-based planner, the representation of discrete time robot states is
					defined as a vector of robot body position, orientation and velocity. For the body of the project,
					my team and I explored three main motion planning algorithms.
				<ol>
					<li>Sequential RRT-Connect (Rapidly Exploring Random Trees) </li>
					<li>Joint Space RRT-Connect</li>
					<li>Conflict Based Search</li>
				</ol>

				<div class="box alt">
					<div class="row gtr-uniform">
						<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/16.782/head2head.png"
									alt="" /></span>
						</div>
						<div class="col-5"><span class="vid fit"><video controls>
									<source src="images/16.782/head2head.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				The Sequential RRT-Connect operates by successively solving a path for each robot. By treating all prior
				paths as static obstacles and independently planning for each robot, we reduce the computational
				complexity of the process, improving speed, but at the sacrifice probabilistic completeness.
				The Joint Space RRT-Connect considers all robots simultaneously and solves for a trajectory in the joint
				state space of all robots. This approach is more comprehensive, and maintains completeness but scales
				poorly do to the increased state complexity.
				Finally, the CBS acts as the middle ground, planning for each robot individually using a low level
				RRT-Connect, while identifying and resolving path conflicts as they appear in its high-level search.
				This method aims to combine the best of both worlds, taking advantage of the individuality of the
				sequential RRT, and only solving the joint space problem when necessary.
				Throughout the project, my main responsibilities included implementing and testing the conflict-based
				search, as well as onboarding my teammates on the codebase and debugging any errors they might
				encounter.<br><br>

				<b>Results:</b><br>
				We demonstrated the success of each method using simulation tests conducted in Gazebo and Rviz. For
				validity, the number of agents was set to two, but later extended to four to see how each method scales.
				In each scenario, we show that the planner can compute kino-dynamically feasible, collision free body
				trajectories for multiple robots over a number of randomly generated trial environments. The results are
				shown in the table below.
				<br><br>
				<table class="alt">
					<thead>
						<tr>

				Ultimately, as expected the sequential planner was the quickest, but often output suboptimal paths, and
				would often fail when subsequent robots became over constrained. The joint planner performed better, and
				allowed for crossing paths, but this often resulted in longer solve times. On average, the CBS performed
				best, with a shorter average path length and a decent average planning time.<br><br>
				The results demonstrate the importance of application specific planners, particularly for
				implementations where tradeoffs can be made on speed, computational complexity, completeness, and
				efficiency. CBS remains the most versatile approach, but the overall project highlights the continued
				need for scalable solutions to real world multi-agent motion planning.

				<p>In this paper we show a trajectory planning technique that mimics a monkey bar robot swinging from
					bar to bar.
					Using a hybrid system direct collocation (DIRCOL) trajectory optimization, we successfully
					demonstrate the robot swinging
					up from a dead hang to catch the first bar and swing to the subsequent bars. This DIRCOL technique
					was tested on various
					mass distributions in the robot as well as different bar separation distances to understand the
					behavior with varying parameters.
					In addition, we show the importance of a free time setup on the cost function in producing
					consistent feasible trajectories using
					this DIRCOL technique.

				<p>In recent years, there has been a large research focus on dense video captioning.
					Video captioning has applications in many fields such as autonomous driving,
					video surveillance and creating captions for those with visual impairments. As
					such, a novel approach is proposed by employing language models (LM) to help to
					semantically align video features in an attempt to improve the overall performance
					of dense video captioning. The baseline model for comparison, End-to-end dense
					video captioning with parallel decoding (PDVC) [1], produced strong results
					compared to many state of the art video captioning frameworks. PDVC is trained
					on the ActivityNet and YouCook2 datasets but for this study only YouCook2
					was used due to computational capacity limits. We propose the incorporation
					of semantic alignment through the addition of a tuner network before the video
					features are passed through the PDVC framework. Ablations were ran for different
					tuner architectures and overall, the modified PDVC framework outperformed the
					baseline PDVC in many evaluation metrics. Promising future extensions with
					Semantic alignment and Dense Video Captioning remain with its application to
					larger and more comprehensive data sets.

				<!-- 24.678 Begins Here-->
				<h3 class="major" id="s24.678"> 24.678 : Computer Vision for Engineers (Fall 2022)</h3>
				<p><b>Objective:</b><br>
					While taking CMUâ€™s 24.678, my team and I decided to apply traditional computer vision techniques to
					tackle the growing incidence rates of fatal injuries on construction sites nationwide. As the number
					of
					such injuries has risen by nearly 90% in the last three years, my team devised a method to improve
					worker awareness and safety on jobsites, maximizing company profits and reducing worker
					downtime.<br><br>
					<b>Solution:</b><br>
					My team developed a system that combines image processing and point cloud-based computer vision
					methods to track the movement of workers around construction sites and notify them when they enter
					potentially dangerous regions. For simplicity, we targeted the most common construction site hazard,
					workers being struck by falling objects. Ideally, weâ€™d like this technology to allow us to prevent
					some of the accidents we see every year.<br><br>
					To solve this problem, we propose a multistep method. First, we preprocess our worksite by
					selecting four fixed reference points in the cameraâ€™s field of view. Given a video stream of the
					worksite, we need a reliable way to make worker positions in the image to worker positions in space.
					To do this, we operate under the assumption that the camera position is fixed, and all workers are
					on the same plane (the ground). This allows us to generate a static transformation that maps pixel
					values to world coordinate values (assuming the worksite shape and dimensions are known). This
					allows
					us to account for the unique perspective of our camera and generate the respective transformation
					matrix.

						</div>
						<div class="col-3"></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				Subsequently, we segment our video stream into individual frames that our YOLOv7 network can
				process. Transfer learning was done to refine the performance of the network on our construction
				site dataset. Using YOLO for object detection, we can identify workers in each image, and output a
				corresponding object bounding box. Given the pixel values for the center of the bounding box, we can
				extract the workers position by average the bottom of the box.

									alt="" /></span></div>
						<div class="col-3"></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				Using our predefined transformation matrix, we can map video coordinates to world coordinates, and
				generate a map of worker positions for each frame. These coordinates are also scaled by the size our
				output frame and boundary. Each frame is then stitched together to create an animation that
				describes worker position progression over time. For our simulation, we predefine danger areas,
				although a network can be trained to identify risky or potentially dangerous objects.<br> <br>

				<b>Results:</b><br>
				For a quick representation of worker position, we plotted their location from a birds-eye view, In
				the future, we plan to generate a more comprehensive representation of worker position, perhaps
				incorporating velocities or making predictions about future worker behavior. Extending the method to
				work with multiple cameras and occlusions also remains future work. Ultimately, we were able to
				successfully track the location of each worker in a variety of environments.

				<!-- 24.695 Begins Here-->
				<h3 class="major" id="s24.695"> 24.695 : Modern Control Theory (Fall 2022)</h3>
				<p><b>Objective:</b><br>
					As a student in 24.695, CMUâ€™s Control Theory class, I was assigned the challenge of creating an
					efficient controller and estimator for a small self-driving vehicle. Given the projected expansion
					of the driverless car industry to reach 93 billion by 2028, this project is geared towards
					addressing that growth. For this project, we drew inspiration from <a
						href="https://www.cmu.edu/buggy/">CMUâ€™s yearly buggy competition</a>
					for our track design and developed an optimal controller for the car.<br><br>
					<b>Solution:</b><br> <span class="image right"><img src="images/24.695/bicycle.png" alt="" /></span>
					To approximate the motion of the car, a simple bicycle model was used to define system dynamics. The
					car is modeled as a two wheeled vehicle with two degrees of freedom described by its longitudinal
					and lateral dynamics. As such, I designed a two-part controller that generates control commands
					including desired steering angle Î´ and longitudinal force f.
					Given a desired trajectory of waypoints, I implemented a:
				<ol>
					<li>PID Controller</li>
					<li>State Feedback Controller</li>
					<li>LQR Controller</li>
					<li>MPC Controller</li>
				</ol>
				To optimize the performance of the PID controller, I tuned the associated proportional, derivative,
				and integral gains. For the static LQR controller, I discretized the continuous error dynamics of
				the nonlinear system using a zero order hold, and then designed an infinite horizon LQR controller
				for the system. Similarly, to implement the MPC, I implemented an iterative finite horizon LQR for a
				tunable horizon size N in the future. Ultimately, the controller was able to get the buggy to
				accelerate on the straight portions of the track, while slowing accordingly for turns.<br>

									<source src="images/24.695/1080.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				In the event that localization information is missing from GPS, autonomous cars often use CV/LIDAR
				based methods for obstacle avoidance. In an effort to incorporate this into our model, I implemented
				EKF SLAM, a sensor fusion method used to augment our position estimate with local measurements.
				Taking advantage range and bearing measurements to the next waypoint, the buggy was able to maintain
				a stable estimate of position and heading over the entire track.<br><br>

				<b>Results:</b><br>
				To assess the performance of our simulation, we tested the model on a track modeled after CMUâ€™s
				buggy course. Driving simulations were then performed using Webots software. The model was able to
				complete the track in under 120 seconds and had an average deviation of less than 3 meters from the
				optimal tracked path.

									alt="" /></span></div>
					</div>
				</div>
				This performance was substantially better than the real-world buggy raced every year at CMU. By the
				end of the course, each controller design was able to clear desired performance evaluations.
