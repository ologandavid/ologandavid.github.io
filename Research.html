				<h3 class="major">Quad-SDK Update: Estimation, Underbrush, and Other Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					This report presents extensions to Quad-SDK,
					a full-stack, open-source ROS based framework for control
					of quadrupedal locomotion. The modular software integrates
					motion planning, control, simulation, and estimation, while
					streamlining the development of novel robotics packages.
					With this update, Quad-SDK now incorporates an Extended
					Kalman Filter (EKF) for reliable onboard state estimation.
					Additionally, a specialized controller designed for walking
					through entanglements has been added, allowing the robot
					to disentangle itself from vine-like obstructions. Both serve
					to enable more reliable outdoor locomotion. Finally, several
					improvements have been made to the software architecture.

				<p>
					Entanglements like vines and branches in natural settings or cords and pipes in human spaces prevent
					mobile robots from accessing many environments. Legged robots should be effective in these settings,
					and more so than wheeled or tracked platforms, but naive controllers quickly become entangled and
					stuck. In this paper we present a method for proprioception aimed specifically at the task of
					sensing entanglements of a robot's legs as well as a reaction strategy to disentangle legs during
					their swing phase as they advance to their next foothold. We demonstrate our proprioception and
					reaction strategy enables traversal of entanglements of many stiffnesses and geometries succeeding
					in 14 out of 16 trials in laboratory tests, as well as a natural outdoor environment.

				<p><b>Objective:</b><br>
					Through MIT’s ELO Program, a team of three undergraduate students (including myself) partnered with
					Prof. Daniel Frey and VME (Volunteers for Medical Engineering) to design a portable, compactable
					sit-to-stand apparatus to help our elderly client with her needs in handicapped bathrooms. As the
					design needed to still function as a wheelchair, the design adds less than 15 pounds to the frame of
					the chair, while narrowly fitting within its margins. Our first prototype is pictured below: </p>

				<p><b>Solution:</b><br>
					The device is tailored for the transfer of the user from the wheelchair onto the surface of the
					toilet seat. It accomplishes this by first securing the user to the sit to stand using a harness. An
					attendant then uses a lever made from a ratchet wrench to rotate the pulley and gently lift the user
					out of their seat. Finally, the pulley system is mounted on a rotating base, which moves the user
					over the toilet for cleaning. The system is held secure by mounting onto the ADA required grab bar
					in the bathroom.

					The product was manufactured with the help of MIT’s D-LAB. Additionally, we partnered with MIT
					Sandbox to market and sell the product to assistive care facilities and hospitals.
					As a member of the team, my work focused on exploring and designing possible methods of actuation
					and organizing the manufacturing of parts.

				<p> During my freshman summer, I fabricated a glass heat resistant enclosure for thermal energy storage
					experiments.
					The preexisting acrylic shielding was unable to handle the heat emitted by the Induction Heater and
					had begun melting. Instead, I designed an
					easily replacable, heat resistant enclosure, to better suit the needs of the device and our
					research.
					I also performed experiments on various materials to determine latent heat properties for storing
					electric energy through TES.
				</p>
				<p>
					While in the RK, I also designed and repaired lab specific lab specific equipment for HFI-5
					Induction Heater, Cooling System.

				<p> During my freshman year of undergrad, I was sponsored by MIT through Projx in the construction of an
					electric longboard. I designed an adjustable motor mount to secure the motor to the longboard
					trucks. I also designed an 48T HTD5 Wheel Pulley to fit my particular wheels, which was printed out
					of ABS for strength.
					<br><br>
					The mount components were manufactured using ½” 60-61 aluminum and a shop waterjet and mill. An ESC
					(Electronic Speed Controller) was used for motor control while parallel LiPo batteries were used to
					power the system. The longboard reached a recorded max speed of 28 mph. The build was completed at
					MITERS (MIT Electronics Research Society).

				<p>Starting in my junior year of high school, I worked as a research assistant at Columbia Unversity. I
					assisted in the creation
					of a Sequence Stratigraphy Algorithm to determine Seismic Risk in the Marmara Sea. The Python based
					model was then used to analyze Seismic Data from the region.
					Paper won 1st Place at Sigma Xi Student Research Showcase in the GeoSciences Division.
