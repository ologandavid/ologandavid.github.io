Hi! I’m currently a second-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Mechanical Engineering. My research focuses on leveraging reinforcement learning and optimization-based control methods for autonomous locomotion in complex, contact-rich natural environments.

I am currently advised by Prof. Aaron Johnson in the Robomechanics Lab, and am fortunate to be supported by the GEM PhD University Fellowship. 

I also recently recieved my MS from CMU in Mechanical Engineering, and a BS from MIT in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I expect to graduate in May of 2028, and I'm currently looking for internship positions starting in the summer of 2026. Please take a look at some of the projects I’ve been working on!
