In recent years, there has been a large research focus on dense video captioning. Video captioning has applications in many fields such as autonomous driving, video surveillance and creating captions for those with visual impairments. As such, a novel approach is proposed by employing language models (LM) to help to semantically align video features in an attempt to improve the overall performance of dense video captioning. The baseline model for comparison, End-to-end dense video captioning with parallel decoding (PDVC) [1], produced strong results compared to many state of the art video captioning frameworks. PDVC is trained on the ActivityNet and YouCook2 datasets but for this study only YouCook2 was used due to computational capacity limits. We propose the incorporation of semantic alignment through the addition of a tuner network before the video features are passed through the PDVC framework. Ablations were ran for different tuner architectures and overall, the modified PDVC framework outperformed the baseline PDVC in many evaluation metrics. Promising future extensions with Semantic alignment and Dense Video Captioning remain with its application to larger and more comprehensive data sets.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
